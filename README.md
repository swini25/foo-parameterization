# Foo Parameterization Software Package

Welcome to the Foo Parameterization software package! This package provides a simple implementation of the Foo et al. parameterization, which, for our purposes, calculates the volume of a sphere based on its radius.

## About

This software package is designed to serve as a community project, with the potential for continuous improvement and the introduction of new features over time by various contributors. The initial implementation focuses on providing a basic functionality to calculate the volume of a sphere.

**Design Considerations**

1. **Community Collaboration**: The software is designed as a community project, with the expectation of continuous improvement and the introduction of new features over time by various contributors. To facilitate collaboration, the codebase is structured to be modular and well-documented, making it easy for developers to understand, extend, and maintain.

2. **User Accessibility**: The target audience for this software package includes both end-users who may interact with the software directly and developers who may incorporate its functionality into larger software projects. As such, the software is designed to be user-friendly, with clear and intuitive interfaces, as well as easily integratable components that can be seamlessly incorporated into other software applications.

3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: The design of the software prioritizes scalability and flexibility to accommodate future enhancements and changes. The architecture is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing new features to be added without significantly impacting existing functionality. Additionally, the choice of programming language and development tools is flexible, allowing for adaptation to different environments and requirements.

**Implementation Details**

The software package consists of the following components:

- **Main Class**: Responsible for executing the software and handling user input.
- **Sphere Class**: Represents a sphere object with a given radius and provides methods for calculating its volume.
- **FooParameterization Class**: Implements the Foo et al. parameterization algorithm to calculate the volume of a sphere.

### Files

- **src/main/java/com/example**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `Main.java`: Main class for executing the software.
  - `model/Sphere.java`: Class representing a sphere.
  - `service/FooParameterization.java`: Class implementing the Foo et al. parameterization.
- **src/test/java/com/example**: Contains unit tests for the project.
  - `model/SphereTest.java`: Unit tests for the `Sphere` class.
- **pom.xml**: Maven project configuration file.

## Installation

To use this software package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/foo-parameterization.git
```

2. Build the project using Maven:

```
mvn clean install
```

3. Run the project:

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
```

## Usage

Once the project is built and running, follow the prompts to input the radius of the sphere. The software will then calculate and display the volume of the sphere.
